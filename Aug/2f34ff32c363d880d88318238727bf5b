Thembisa Mdoda quits Our Perfect Wedding after getting a new boyfriend on the TV show Published: 29 August 2017 Written by sowetan Share on Facebook View Comments Presenter Thembisa Mdoda is getting ready to bid farewell to the reality TV show, Our Perfect Wedding, after two years. Mdoda revealed that the show not only brought her stardom, awards and critical acclaim, but she also found love on the show. &quot;It&#39;s the most cliched thing you will ever hear. I found love on Our Perfect Wedding. We are happy and planning a future together,&quot; Mdoda shared. &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful thing. He&#39;s a great guy, and for me to find someone in the space that I work in and who I totally fell in love with is amazing.&quot; Mdoda was the big winner at the inaugural DStv Mzansi Viewers&#39; Choice Awards on Saturday night. She scooped Best Presenter and Ultimate Viewers&#39; Choice. &quot;What an incredible way to end the journey. These past two years have been a roller-coaster, but I&#39;ve had the time of my life. I&#39;ve put my all into the show and the fact that people took their time and money to vote that &#39;you are doing a great job&#39; makes me so thankful. I&#39;m going to miss everything about the show because it has been part of my life for so long, from connecting with people at weddings, to the jittery feeling that the bride gets and then you calm her down. I&#39;m going to miss the prayer time before they go out, the singing, dancing and saying my catch phrase [Sifike! Sabona! Satshatisa!],&quot; Mdoda said. Mdoda came dressed like a winner in a cleavage-hugging Ndebele print number, paired with a matching bright-hued doek. The dress was designed by third-year fashion student Theodorah Zulu. &quot;Tonight, I just wanted to look regal, elegant and open. The universe must know that I&#39;m at peace,&quot; Mdoda said. Hosted by Bonang Matheba, other winners of the night included Kwesta, Caster Semenya, Vatiswa Ndara, Sjava and Black Coffee. Artists such as Thandiswa Mazwai, Lebo Sekgobela, Hugh Masekela, Cassper Nyovest and AKA performed on the night. Social media provocateur Zodwa Wabantu made a surprise appearance on stage during Lady Zamar&#39;s performance and showed off her signature dance moves.
