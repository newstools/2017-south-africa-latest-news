Jessica Nkosi text shocker Published: 13 August 2017 Written by Online Writer Share on Facebook View Comments UZALO actor TK Dlamini has allegedly found love in the arms of Isibaya actress Jessica Nkosi. Sunday Sun spotted them last week at Dream Hair Salon at Gateway Theatre of Shopping, in Umhlanga Ridge, north of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, when TK was dropping Jessica off. Sources close to the pair say they&rsquo;ve kept their relationship under wraps for months now and have kept their fans fooled. &ldquo;TK was like opening a can of worms at Cashflow&rsquo;s birthday party when he received a WhatsApp text from Jessica and was irritated by it. &ldquo;He decided to show the text to those around him to prove she&rsquo;s got diva tendencies,&rdquo; said a source. Another source said: &ldquo;Whenever Jessica&rsquo;s in Durban, she&rsquo;s seen driving TK&rsquo;s Audi and is often at his house. &ldquo;At the Durban July they walked into the Fact Durban Rocks concert holding hands, which caused a stir in the VIP area.&rdquo; TK neither denied nor confirmed, saying: &ldquo;Why choose her only? This is not right. I think our industry gets people confused, sometimes, when they see us together. &ldquo;I respect everyone in the industry. &ldquo;By the way, where did you get that info from?&rdquo; Yesterday, when the SunTeam called Jessica, she refused to comment and hung up. - Sunday Sun View the discussion thread. blog comments powered by DISQUS back to top Google Tweet Pin it Tweet Next
