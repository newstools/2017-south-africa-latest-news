Vusi Nova finally opens up on hijack attack: They stripped me naked, forced me to sing Published: 28 August 2017 Written by Staff Reporter Share on Facebook View Comments Vusi Nova is counting on his own strength to get through his hijacking ordeal. The award-winning Afro-soul crooner, whose real name is Vusi Nongxa, was abducted from his home in Melville, Johannesburg, in his car in the early hours of Friday and dumped in Chiawelo, Soweto. The hijackers made off with his car and clothes. He was left with only his underwear. Yesterday, Nova complained about a painful eye, which he suspected could be infected. &quot;My right eye is killing me. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the punches [from the attackers],&quot; he said. Nova has also shunned professional psychological help, opting to do things his way. &quot;It [seeing the psychologist] was a waste of my time. It just annoyed me because I knew it was not going to help with anything. I&#39;ve been through so many things in my life and I have to carry on. I&#39;ve always relied on myself. The number one person is me. I have to be strong for myself. Family is great and it&#39;s there to help too. I&#39;m humbled by the good wishes from my supporters and people who have put my number plates out there to help in finding my car.&quot; Nova said he moved into his new house where the incident happened two months ago. &quot;I&#39;m not going to let people chase me away from my place. I won&#39;t let this experience cripple my life,&quot; he said. He said the attackers pounced when he least expected it. Nova said they were saying goodbyes to four other men, members of new group 047 , when they were interrupted by thugs who pushed him to the back of his car and ordered that he put his head down, along with a man identified as Sihle from 047. &quot;I later heard a gunshot and worried that they shot someone. He was hysterical. He was crying uncontrollably and I asked that they let him go and they wouldn&#39;t. Instead they slapped me. I was so calm, it&#39;s the kind of person I am. &quot;They slapped me many times... They said they would cut my d*ck off and my nipples and then kill me,&quot; he said. Nova didn&#39;t believe that the robbers recognised who he was. &quot;They asked me what I did for a living and I said I sang and they instructed me to sing and I told them I didn&#39;t have a voice and they slapped me.&quot; The attackers drove around with him and withdrew cash from his account before taking his cellphone and letting him out. His good Samaritan came in the form of a young woman who recognised him and offered him a flimsy top. &quot;I was able to cover myself but it didn&#39;t help with the cold.&quot; They then got him a taxi to take him back home. &quot;It&#39;s terrible that people have the courage to attack others in this way. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s to be done. Maybe it starts with talking about it.&quot; Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said by yesterday afternoon they had not made any arrests in the matter.
