SAD: Amo 'Reneilwe' Chidi speaks on Dumi's death Published: 11 August 2017 Written by Online Writer Share on Facebook View Comments Amo Chidi is still trying to come to terms with Dumi&#39;s passing away. Such a young vibrant soul with big dreams and he was very matured for his age. The level of respect he had really humbled us all. He was very down to earth yet very fun to be around. Working with him had been a pleasure. I&#39;ve worked closely with him and he was a proud and very happy husband. His death broke my heart completely. When coming to work I wish I could just see him and laugh with him one last time. The studio isn&#39;t the same anymore,his absence is very loud.
