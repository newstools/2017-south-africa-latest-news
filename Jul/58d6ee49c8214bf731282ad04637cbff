'This cow is my hubby' Published: 23 July 2017 Written by Online Writer Share on Facebook CAMBODIA&#39;S latest social media sensation is a five-month-old calf believed by a villager to be the reincarnation of her dead husband. Khim Hang (74) said up to 100 people a day visit her home in northeast Kratie province to see the calf she said behaves very similarly to her husband, Tol Khut, who died more than a year ago. &quot;I believe that the calf is my husband because whatever he does...is in exactly the same way as my husband did when he was alive,&quot; she told Reuters Television. The young cow was born in March and has attracted a strong following on social media. &quot;I thought it was quite unusual to see a cow go up to the house like this,&quot; said Thach Vin (32), referring to a video she saw on Facebook in which the calf walked up stairs into the family&#39;s one-storey home. &quot;So I came here to see it with my own eyes,&quot; she said. Once inside the wooden house, the calf is fed, washed and put to bed with a fluffy pillow once used by Tol Khut. Cambodia is 95 percent Buddhist and many believe the soul of a person is reincarnated after death. &quot;I will keep him and take care of him for my entire life,&quot; said Khim Hang. - Daily Sun Google Tweet Pin it Tweet Prev Next Comments (0 ) There are no comments posted here yet &nbsp; Quick Login Username Password Login Sign Up Leave your comments Posting comment as a guest.
