ZCC Pastor s daughter jumps in front of moving train after video l3ak Published: 21 July 2017 Written by Online Writer Share on Facebook A ZCC Pastor &lsquo;s daughter committed suicide yesterday by jumping in front of a train after a video of her in a th_reesome with another girl and a male leaked on Social media. Lerato Chauke whose father is a prominent Pretoria Pastor could not take the shame after the video started to trend on Whatsapp. In the 5 min video Lerato is seen being intimate with an unidentified girl whilst the male hit her from behind.The action goes back and forth with Lerato&rsquo;s ecstatic screams filling up the room. A church member who spoke on condition of anonymity divulged how Lerato lived a double life. &ldquo;Lerato was her father&rsquo;s pride,she was in the church choir and would always take the time to preach in church and was an inspiration to the youths.The video however ruined her and she felt she had no option but to take her own life. Pastor Chauke&rsquo;s phone &ndash; which eventually was switched off-went unanswered before we could get a comment.
