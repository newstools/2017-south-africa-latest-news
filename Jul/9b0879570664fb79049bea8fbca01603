Babes Wodumo gets DUMPED!! Published: 27 July 2017 Written by Online Writer Share on Facebook View Comments The PR company has previously represented AKA and Cassper Nyovest. In a lengthy statement African Star Communications, owned by Farah Fortune, has said it will no longer be representing Babes Wodumo. The gqom singer joined the company a month ago after receiving bad press for her failed trip to the US for the BET Awards and for publishing a video where she and her manager, Mampintsha, were upset about her not winning any awards at the South African Music Awards. The PR move was apparently to give Babes brand a revamp and generate more positive publicity for her. African Star Communications has always had a company policy of not representing record labels in their entirety but rather individual artists. We deem it unethical to represent a record label when we speak on behalf of a number of artists under different stables. The decision comes as Babes Wodumo s label and management company, West Ink, have chosen to use one PR agency to represent all their artists. We were approached by the label to handle their PR as well as their clients, however due to our company policy on record labels and the fact that we only take on approximately 10 celeb clients at a time, we are unable to accommodate further, the statement read.
