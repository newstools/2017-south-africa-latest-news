The Real Face Of Jesus Published: 24 July 2017 Written by Online Writer Share on Facebook They analyzed three skulls from archeological dig sites and were able to figure out a possible shape of Jesus&#39; head and facial muscles, but they were NOT able to accurately determine the color of his skin and hair with that. Forensic science has revealed the real face of Jesus: https://t.co/m8JFizp6CQ pic.twitter.com/juwik7nW5T&mdash; Esquire (@esquire) December 11, 2015 The discovery came after researchers evaluated drawings found in various archaeological sites in Israel. Thus the dark skin, eyes and traditional Jewish beard with short, curly hair. The latest image is a stark contrast to how He is portrayed in paintings and pictures who appears leaner with long flowy hair. Earlier this year a picture re-emerged that showed what Jesus might have looked like as a kid. Detectives took the Turin Shroud, believed to show Jesus&#39; image, and created a photo-fit image from the material. They used a computer program to reverse the aging process. After reducing his jaw size, slimming his face and softening his eyes -- a 12-year-old Jesus appeared. Still, these predictions aren&#39;t based on much evidence as The New Testament of the Holy Bible doesn&#39;t provide any detailed description of Christ, nor have any drawings of him been discovered.
