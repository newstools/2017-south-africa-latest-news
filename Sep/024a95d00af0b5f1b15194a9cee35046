MEET the taxi driver who gave a lift to a GHOST Published: 05 September 2017 Written by Dailysun Share on Facebook View Comments RABELANI Manzere has seen many things in his career as a taxi driver but yesterday, he had a supernatural experience. The 32-year-old from Northgate, Joburg, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I gave a lift to a ghost!&rdquo; Rabelani said he was driving in Randburg when he picked up a short gogo who was carrying plastic bags. &ldquo;I stopped the taxi and opened the door for her. When she got in, she told me she was glad she had found me, which was strange.&rdquo; Rabelani said while he was driving, the gogo asked him to switch on the light so she could pay him &ndash; but what happened next was terrifying. &ldquo;She put her hand in her purse and it seemed to get stuck. &ldquo;Suddenly, her face became pale and her eyes, nose and lips became pink.&rdquo; Rabelani locked eyes with the gogo and felt fear rippling through his body. &ldquo;She widened her eyes and started shrieking. Then she flew out of a closed window and disappeared. &ldquo;I jumped out of the moving taxi and ran away. I was screaming for help and crying. &ldquo;When I stopped another taxi driver and asked for help, he fled.&rdquo; Luckily, another driver stopped and helped him. Rabelani said he was later told another taxi driver had seen the same ghost. The other driver told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I was driving along the same road when I saw a gogo carrying luggage. &ldquo;She asked me to pick her up but when I switched on the light she refused to get in and disappeared.&rdquo; View the discussion thread. blog comments powered by DISQUS back to top Google Tweet Pin it Tweet Next
