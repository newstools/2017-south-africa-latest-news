Community shocked as teenage girl confesses to selling body parts of dead people Published: 09 September 2017 Written by Dailysun Share on Facebook View Comments LAST week, a teenage girl shocked her community when she confessed to selling body parts of dead people. The 17-year-old girl said she worked with her 23-year-old boyfriend. Their plan meant exhuming graves and stealing body parts from the dead. Two of the graves she pointed out to the police were dug up and what she had told them was true. She told the police her boyfriend sold the parts to a powerful sangoma. Last Tuesday, forensic experts exhumed one of the graves belonging to Alpheus Vhudzikadzika, who was buried three years ago. His head was missing, as the girl had confessed. Yesterday, forensic experts went to Tshitavha Cemetery outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo to exhume another grave. This belonged to Ntshumbedzeni Phundulu and it was empty. Ntshumbedzeni was buried in 2007 at the age of 69. The girl had told the police that his entire remains were cut into pieces and sold. The dead man&rsquo;s daughter, Joyce Phundulu (49), said they were shocked by the incident. She said: &ldquo;How could such young people be so heartless? &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do anything for money and aren&rsquo;t even afraid of the dead. Now it&rsquo;s useless for us to visit an empty grave.&rdquo; Joyce said she hoped all those involved were brought to book. As forensic experts were digging up the grave, some community members were at the cemetery to check if their relatives&rsquo; graves had been tampered with. A villager said: &ldquo;The cemetery is far from our homes, so that&rsquo;s why the suspects were able to dig up the graves and cover them again at night.&rdquo; Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo appealled to Daniel Nephawe to come forward to assist them with their investigations.
