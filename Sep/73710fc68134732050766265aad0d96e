Shock as man commits suicide after lover dumps him, leaves note Published: 18 September 2017 Written by Online Correspondent Share on Facebook View Comments A young man in Butterworth, East London who could not take the fact that his girlfriend had dumped him, decided to end it all by committing suicide. The heartbroken lover boy who mixed some poisonous substance with fruit juice and drank to his death, also left a suicide note, stating that the girl whose name he gave as Hilda, broke his heart after all he did for her. He indicated in the note that he decided to take his life because the lady, despite all he did for her, was not satisfied and as such, he had to kill himself&nbsp; so that she can have another boyfriend and stop disturbing him. &quot;Hi Hilda, why are you doing this to me? If you don&#39;t love me, Why didn&#39;t you tell me, and now what you are doing to me? I gave you my heart, my everything, but you were not ok. Have nothing to tell you. I kill myself cos of you, so that you can have another boyfriend and no disturbance for you. We shall meet one day. Still love you more. Bye bye&quot; &nbsp; View the discussion thread. blog comments powered by DISQUS back to top Google Tweet Pin it Tweet Next
