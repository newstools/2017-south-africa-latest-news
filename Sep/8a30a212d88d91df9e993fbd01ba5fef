Officer Mfanafuthi Hlomuka (34) stopped a bakkie on the Golden Highway near Finetown, south of Joburg, last Friday. While busy with the bakkie, a bus drove into it from behind, crushing the father of two. He died on the spot. Metro police officers gathered at the place where the horrific incident happened, joined by their superiors, including City of Joburg MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun, who also laid a wreath. He was followed by Hlomuka&rsquo;s large family. JMPD officers came in large numbers to support one of their colleagues, who was known as hardworking and dedicated. They planted a cross on the side of the road and laid a wreath. As the cross was planted, the officer&rsquo;s wife couldn&rsquo;t hold back her tears. Speaking at the event, Sun said they were saddened by the incident. &ldquo;We are here to offer our condolences to the family as well as tell them that Hlomuka will not be forgotten.&rdquo; He said the city had started an initiative to help families of officers killed in the line of duty. &ldquo;This initiative will make sure that the wives or husbands and children of officers are taken care of.&rdquo; JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said Hlomuka was a dedicated officer who died serving the people. &ldquo;He will forever be missed,&rdquo; said Minnaar. After the wreath-laying ceremony, everyone headed for the JMPD offices in downtown Joburg, where a memorial service was held.
