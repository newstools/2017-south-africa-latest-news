Murderer who ate victim's flesh in full view of neighbours shot dead by cops after he charged at them with bloody knife Published: 14 September 2017 Written by Dailysun Share on Facebook View Comments WHEN Thumeka Masumpa heard on Tuesday that the man who had murdered and eaten parts of her sister was dead, she was able to breathe again. Her sister Thembeka&rsquo;s brutal death on Saturday at the hands of Aphiwe Mapekula in Mount Frere, Eastern Cape, shocked the country. Aphiwe (23) died in hospital on Tuesday after cops shot him when he charged at them with a bloody knife. Thembeka (34) was leaving her employer&rsquo;s house when he suddenly came up behind her and slit her throat. He then started slicing bits of flesh off her body and eating them in full view of terrified neighbours. Thumeka told the SunTeam her sister always feared the Amavondo gang, known for drinking blood, and had said Aphiwe made her feel uncomfortable. Thembeka lived with her sister and 12-year-old son and did odd jobs like laundry in town to make ends meet. The sisters were orphans. &ldquo;Thembeka had planned to go to church to pray for protection from the Amavondo members after work on Saturday. She even joked about her weight, saying they would get lots of meat from her.&rdquo; Thumeka said when she heard Aphiwe&rsquo;s relatives wanted to meet her family, she refused. &ldquo;I know my temper is short and I would have stabbed somebody to avenge my sister. I couldn&rsquo;t even eat until I heard on the radio that he had died.&rdquo; Thumeka said her sister told her Aphiwe was violent and sometimes had to be restrained by neighbours.
