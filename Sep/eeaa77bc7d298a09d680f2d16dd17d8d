The case was held at the Randburg Magistrate&#39;s Court where Manana pleaded guilty, it was adjourned to 7 November for sentencing. Meanwhile, another man was arrested at the court after being pointed out by one of the victims and immediately taken to the Randburg copshop. Manana admitted to assaulting two women at Cubana in Fourways, Johannesburg for calling him gay. In a new twist, students from the University of Johannesburg, Fort Hare and TUT protested outside the court in support of Manana. They held placards that read: &quot;He is remorseful, let us forgive.&quot; A second one read: &quot;Good leaders know when they are wrong.&quot; UJ student Brian Matyila said Manana was a young leader that they were proud of. &quot;He has been an inspiration of ours and when we were calling for free education, he was one of the few people who gave us a voice and listened to us,&quot; Matyila said. A small group of DA supporters were also seen at the main entrance of the court. Another group of individuals gathered inside the court with t-shirts written #NotInMyName to support the assaulted women.
